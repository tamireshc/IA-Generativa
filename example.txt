The old woman sat on the park bench, watching the children play. She smiled as she remembered a time when she was young and carefree, just like them. 1   A small boy, noticing her smile,  approached shyly and offered her a bright red leaf. "It's for you," he whispered.  Touched by his kindness, the woman's smile widened. "Thank you," she said, "it's beautiful."  As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the park, the woman felt a sense of peace settle over her. It was a simple moment, but one that filled her heart with joy.
